## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

This project was quite challenging but a very good learning experience. I became more familiar with CSS custom properties, working with SVGs, Javascript DOM manipulation, and working with JSON files. The Javascript logic for the adding and removing items from the cart seemed straightforward at first, however I ran into some trouble implementing it and keeping everything together. It all worked out in the end, though, and I learned a lot about functions, string manipulation, and DOM manipulation with javascript.
